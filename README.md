# Necessary Bimbos
An illustrated branching bimbofication story by Limerick and Sortimid

*Necessary Bimbos is about a young guy who wakes up with a headache after a fight with his girlfriend.  While trying to smooth things over, he keeps inadvertently changing reality --- her background, clothes, even how the world works!*

*How far will he go?*

*You get to decide!*

*There are twelve different endings and over 60 illustrations covering 38,000 words!*

You found the source code! Congrats! You might notice there is no access control. I consciously prioritized easy deployment and hassle-free access over convoluted DRM schemes. I'd rather spend my time being creative than chasing piracy. If that also nets me some good will, even better! **Please keep this to yourself.** If I notice a lot of people abusing this loophole, I'll have to restrict access for this and future releases.
